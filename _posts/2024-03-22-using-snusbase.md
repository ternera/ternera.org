For the first time today, I tried using the data breach search engine: Snusbase. I was amazed at the amounts of information that this search engine can provide by giving it an email address or username. I found it interesting to search for some of my older and no longer used email addresses and for other unused aliases to see if they could be linked back to me now.

As you can see from the example below, I tried searching for ```bob@bob.com``` and ```testname``` for testing purposes.

If you have email addresses and/or usernames of yours that you wish to search for, I highly recommend trying this search engine out since it's only $6 for a week of use. This post was not sponsored by Snusbase in any way.
